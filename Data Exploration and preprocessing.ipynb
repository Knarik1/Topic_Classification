Now, after losing back-to-back games to the No. 8 seed Nashville Predators, the situation has gotten so dire that the Penguins may be considering hockey’s nuclear option: switching goaltenders.After Pittsburgh’s Game 4 loss on Monday, coach Mike Sullivan declined to say if Matt Murray would start between the pipes for Thursday’s Game 5. After the team gave up a combined nine goals in its two losses, some have clamored for veteran Marc-Andre Fleury to step in for the 23-year-old Murray.But such a switch would be unprecedented in recent history: No goalie has started Game 5 or later in the Finals after not having started any of the first four since at least 1990, according to Stats LLC.The only reason the Penguins are in this position is because of their absurd depth at the position. They have one of the top young talents in Murray, who leapfrogged Fleury a year ago to lead the team to the title as a rookie. And Fleury, a two-time All-Star who was in net when the team won in 2009, has already been the team’s savior this postseason, highlighted by a shutout in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.This decision—or non-decision—is made even more difficult by the fact that their performances have been so indistinguishable this postseason. Murray, despite his recent struggles, has a .925 save percentage this postseason. That’s one thousandth of a point higher than Fleury’s .924. Murray, meanwhile, is 5-3 as a starter during the playoffs compared with Fleury’s 9-6 record.But to realize why the switch may be rash, Pittsburgh has to look no further than its opponent. Amid doubts about Pekka Rinne’s performance in net to start the series, Nashville coach Peter Laviolette made the smartest move of the series by doing absolutely nothing. Now the series is tied because of that.Not panicking over goaltenders is also one of the lessons from the most famous game in hockey history. After a 2-2 first period in the 1980 Olympic semifinals, Russia benched superstar goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. His backup gave up two goals in the third to lose the game.

       "      <td>A court in the Caribbean island of St. Maarten has ordered Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA to cooperate in the sale of 500,000 barrels of crude oil in its dispute with units of Russian shipping firm Sovcomflot, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters on Tuesday. In March, the same court ordered the roughly $20 million in Venezuelan oil to be held until state-run Sovcomflot's claim for $30 million in unpaid shipping fees is decided in a pending action by a British admiralty court. PDVSA rejects the claim.  Proceeds from the oil sale must be deposited into an escrow account at a Dutch or Antillian bank until the two sides reach a final agreement, the court said.  The crude has been stored at a rented facility on the neighboring island of St. Eustatius, but Sovcomflot requested the oil be sold to a third party, arguing there was no guarantee that the crude would be insured while at the terminal.  The Court of First Instance condemns PDVSA to cooperate on sale by ship owners of the cargo oil... to the best possible terms, including as high a price as possible,  said the order dated July 7 and seen this week. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The court action suggests even political allies of Venezuela such as Russia are losing patience with PDVSA's payment delays. The Venezuelan company's obsolete tankers are struggling to export oil and supply fuel to its domestic market. The court absolved PDVSA of trial costs but said it must pay a penalty of $500,000 per day up to a maximum of $5 million if it fails to comply with the ruling.  It was unclear when the penalty would begin. A PDVSA source said the company would auction the oil as soon as possible.  PDVSA in October sent the cargo on tanker NS Columbus to St. Eustatius, planning to sell the crude from there. But the owner of the tanker, a unit of Russian conglomerate Sovcomflot, asked a Caribbean court to seize the oil in hopes of collecting partial payment. Five months after crossing the Caribbean, the NS Columbus discharged the crude at the Statia terminal in St. Eustatius, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where PDVSA rents storage tanks, under a temporary decision by the St. Maarten court.

       "      <td>A Canadian nurse who used insulin to kill eight elderly patients in long-term care facilities has been sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported on Monday. Elizabeth Wettlaufer pleaded guilty this month to killing five women and three men in the Ontario towns of Woodstock and London between 2007 and 2014. The dead ranged in age from 75 to 96. Wettlaufer then admitted in court in Woodstock, about 140 km (87 miles) west of Toronto, that she fatally injected the victims with insulin for no medical reasons. CBC reported that she apologized in court to her victims' families on Monday, although her motive remains unclear.  The Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Homicide cases with multiple victims are uncommon in Canada. The Wettlaufer case is the largest in Ontario province since 2006, when five men were charged with murdering eight members of a biker gang. They were convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

       "      <td>Losses from cyber crimes rose 24 percent in 2016 to over $1.33 billion, according to a report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The center, which was set up in 2000 to receive complaints of internet crime, received 300,000 complaints during the year from hacking victims. Businesses lost $360 million to cyber criminals, who tricked them into wiring money using fraudulent emails that appeared to be from corporate executives and suppliers, according to the report released on Wednesday. IC3 said it received 2,673 complaints last year from victims of ransomware, with losses totaling over $2.4 million. In May, the WannaCry ransomware attack infected 300,000 computers in more than 150 countries, disrupting factories, hospitals, shops and schools. Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get an electronic key so they can retrieve their data.

       "      <td>Reuters on Friday lost an appeal against a court ruling that stopped the news agency from publishing a story about British hedge fund firm Brevan Howard Asset Management.  Three Court of Appeal judges said that a lower court was correct to rule in March that the story would breach Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and was not of sufficient public interest to justify its publication. Reuters had argued that the March ruling by a High Court judge had given  insufficient weight  to matters of public interest and had failed to take into account the  limited  scope of the confidential information it wanted to publish.       Despite that raft of criticisms of the Judge's judgment, we are clear that the appeal should be dismissed,  Court of Appeal judge Terence Etherton wrote. A spokesman for Reuters said the agency was deeply disappointed.   We continue to believe that the public interest in publication of this information outweighs the confidentiality concerns raised here,  he said.  A spokesman for Brevan Howard said the firm  welcomes the decision of the court that supports the importance of its ability to communicate with its investors in a candid and responsible manner .  Brevan Howard, one of Europe's biggest hedge fund managers, said the Reuters story contained highly sensitive information it had sent to 36 potential investors electronically. Reuters obtained information for the story from confidential sources but when it contacted the hedge fund to ask questions before publication, Brevan Howard sought an injunction on the grounds of breach of confidence. Under Britain's legal system, individuals and companies can file for privacy or confidentiality injunctions to try to stop the media publishing information that they say is confidential. Reuters argued in court that public interest outweighed confidentiality concerns because hedge funds invest on behalf of institutional investors including pension funds, which affect the finances of millions of people. However the appeal court said the judge in March had balanced the public interest case against Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and had made no error of law in his decision.

These are important developments, and a powerful example of the determination of the Libyan people to find peaceful solutions to the ongoing insecurity. Alongside the UN process, these initiatives need the support of all Libyans throughout that country. We strongly condemn all attempts to undermine UN process or local peace initiatives, in particular through the threat of violence. We call on all Libyan decision makers to show in this crucial moment responsibility, leadership and courage. The international community stands ready to provide significant humanitarian, economic and security assistance to a united Libya as soon as the new government is agreed.

       "95     A court in the Caribbean island of St. Maarten has ordered Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA to cooperate in the sale of 500,000 barrels of crude oil in its dispute with units of Russian shipping firm Sovcomflot, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters on Tuesday. In March, the same court ordered the roughly $20 million in Venezuelan oil to be held until state-run Sovcomflot's claim for $30 million in unpaid shipping fees is decided in a pending action by a British admiralty court. PDVSA rejects the claim.  Proceeds from the oil sale must be deposited into an escrow account at a Dutch or Antillian bank until the two sides reach a final agreement, the court said.  The crude has been stored at a rented facility on the neighboring island of St. Eustatius, but Sovcomflot requested the oil be sold to a third party, arguing there was no guarantee that the crude would be insured while at the terminal.  The Court of First Instance condemns PDVSA to cooperate on sale by ship owners of the cargo oil... to the best possible terms, including as high a price as possible,  said the order dated July 7 and seen this week. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The court action suggests even political allies of Venezuela such as Russia are losing patience with PDVSA's payment delays. The Venezuelan company's obsolete tankers are struggling to export oil and supply fuel to its domestic market. The court absolved PDVSA of trial costs but said it must pay a penalty of $500,000 per day up to a maximum of $5 million if it fails to comply with the ruling.  It was unclear when the penalty would begin. A PDVSA source said the company would auction the oil as soon as possible.  PDVSA in October sent the cargo on tanker NS Columbus to St. Eustatius, planning to sell the crude from there. But the owner of the tanker, a unit of Russian conglomerate Sovcomflot, asked a Caribbean court to seize the oil in hopes of collecting partial payment. Five months after crossing the Caribbean, the NS Columbus discharged the crude at the Statia terminal in St. Eustatius, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where PDVSA rents storage tanks, under a temporary decision by the St. Maarten court.

Elizabeth Wettlaufer pleaded guilty this month to killing five women and three men in the Ontario towns of Woodstock and London between 2007 and 2014. The dead ranged in age from 75 to 96. Wettlaufer then admitted in court in Woodstock, about 140 km (87 miles) west of Toronto, that she fatally injected the victims with insulin for no medical reasons. CBC reported that she apologized in court to her victims' families on Monday, although her motive remains unclear.  The Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Homicide cases with multiple victims are uncommon in Canada. The Wettlaufer case is the largest in Ontario province since 2006, when five men were charged with murdering eight members of a biker gang. They were convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

The center, which was set up in 2000 to receive complaints of internet crime, received 300,000 complaints during the year from hacking victims. Businesses lost $360 million to cyber criminals, who tricked them into wiring money using fraudulent emails that appeared to be from corporate executives and suppliers, according to the report released on Wednesday. IC3 said it received 2,673 complaints last year from victims of ransomware, with losses totaling over $2.4 million. In May, the WannaCry ransomware attack infected 300,000 computers in more than 150 countries, disrupting factories, hospitals, shops and schools. Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get an electronic key so they can retrieve their data.

       "262                  Reuters on Friday lost an appeal against a court ruling that stopped the news agency from publishing a story about British hedge fund firm Brevan Howard Asset Management.  Three Court of Appeal judges said that a lower court was correct to rule in March that the story would breach Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and was not of sufficient public interest to justify its publication. Reuters had argued that the March ruling by a High Court judge had given  insufficient weight  to matters of public interest and had failed to take into account the  limited  scope of the confidential information it wanted to publish.       Despite that raft of criticisms of the Judge's judgment, we are clear that the appeal should be dismissed,  Court of Appeal judge Terence Etherton wrote. A spokesman for Reuters said the agency was deeply disappointed.   We continue to believe that the public interest in publication of this information outweighs the confidentiality concerns raised here,  he said.  A spokesman for Brevan Howard said the firm  welcomes the decision of the court that supports the importance of its ability to communicate with its investors in a candid and responsible manner .  Brevan Howard, one of Europe's biggest hedge fund managers, said the Reuters story contained highly sensitive information it had sent to 36 potential investors electronically. Reuters obtained information for the story from confidential sources but when it contacted the hedge fund to ask questions before publication, Brevan Howard sought an injunction on the grounds of breach of confidence. Under Britain's legal system, individuals and companies can file for privacy or confidentiality injunctions to try to stop the media publishing information that they say is confidential. Reuters argued in court that public interest outweighed confidentiality concerns because hedge funds invest on behalf of institutional investors including pension funds, which affect the finances of millions of people. However the appeal court said the judge in March had balanced the public interest case against Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and had made no error of law in his decision.

       "21850                                         We welcome the peace initiatives developing in parts of Libya, particularly in the West, including local-level ceasefires, prisoner exchanges, and the return of internally displaced persons. We recognize that the Libyan people want peace and stability. We welcome the recent round of talks of the UN political dialogue in Skhirat, Morocco. We reiterate our full support to the UN SRSG Bernardino Léon. We urge all Libyan parties to sign in the coming days the political agreement presented by the UN. We consider this document a thoughtful, well-balanced basis for agreement, that meets the urgent expectations of Libyan people and secures the unity of Libya. We reiterate that there is no military solution to this crisis and we underline that the economic and humanitarian situation is worsening every day. We stand ready to support the implementation of this agreement in order to help ensure that a Government of National Accord and all the new institutions function effectively. Governments of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, express deep concern about ongoing violence within Libya, and expansion of terrorism in Libya. These are important developments, and a powerful example of the determination of the Libyan people to find peaceful solutions to the ongoing insecurity. Alongside the UN process, these initiatives need the support of all Libyans throughout that country. We strongly condemn all attempts to undermine UN process or local peace initiatives, in particular through the threat of violence. We call on all Libyan decision makers to show in this crucial moment responsibility, leadership and courage. The international community stands ready to provide significant humanitarian, economic and security assistance to a united Libya as soon as the new government is agreed. Equally, the international community stands ready to hold accountable through sanctions those who threaten Libya’s peace, stability and security.
